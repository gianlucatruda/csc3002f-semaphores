Hi there,

I hope marking is going well. I've tried to make this code as easy for
you to mark as possible. There is a makefile supplied, but the code is already
compiled to the bin directory.

I've generated test scripts under the "tests/" directory. In there
you will also find a Python 3 script that I made for generating
test scripts.

To test my code, you can simply run any of these lines from the
home directory:

$ java -cp bin Simulator tests/standard.txt
$ java -cp bin Simulator tests/stress01.txt
$ java -cp bin Simulator tests/stress02.txt
$ java -cp bin Simulator tests/stress03.txt

* standard.txt is the test script provided in the assingment brief.

* stress01 is "One person who works for a long time at each stop so
the taxi goes into its idle state."

* stress02 is "Many people working for short periods of time, keeping
the taxi busy."

* stress03 is simply ridiculous and made using my python script to
really push the code to its limits.

You can use the python script by running:

$ python3 tests/testgen.py

Thank you for taking the time to mark my work.


Kindest regards,
